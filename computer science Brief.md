## Resources
- some of the resources i found online indacates that people are not getting a lot of running and being active outside more. this is because of the pandemic witch forced people inside and not be as well fit to run [covid effects][https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/well/move/pandemic-exercise-habits-study.html].

## Research
- **Survey Results:**
    - Based on a survey I carried out i found out that a lot of my age group dont really run a lot.
    - I found out that over 70% dont do any active sport.
    - I found out that over 63% had a device that could count steps 
    - I found out when asked why over 86% said that it is not very motavating for them 

## What-If questions
- **for my what if qustion** 
    - What if the user wants to incress thier distance traveled?
    - What if the user wants to decress thier time traveled?
- these qustion will help me carry out my Basic requirements and Advanced requirements 

## Target Audience
- My device target audience is people of the older age group like 18 and over but it maybe use they the younger Audience. it is for thos who want to keep a recound on how far and fast they travel.

## Main Objectives
- i need to find a way to get peoples steps 
- i need to found out how far they travel 
- i need to find the time they toke to travel 
- i need to graph that data 
- i then need to give user feed back on that data 


# Plan and Design 
## How I will meet the requirements
### Basic Requirements
- cheak if the user is over 37 degress this is to cheak if there are sick 

- at the start the user has to put in there height this will go up in incroments of 10 cm when pressed A and 100 cm if B

- when done press A+B to conform the height which will give us the stride length of the user

- to start the run the user will have to press on the other micro bits logo to set the timer to the data base 

- the user then runs to get steps

- user presses the logo button on the micro bit witch sends data to the data base 

- i ask for age to norrow down the grouping 

- i read user data and give them a prodiction and incite on there physical wellbeing
### Advanced Requirements
- for my first what if qustion i gave "What if the user wants to incress thier distance traveled?"
    - i get the users stride, distance and time and then graph the information and then give futer incite on there wellbeing 
- for my secound what if qustion i gave "What if the user wants to decress thier time traveled?"
    - i get the users stride, distance and time and then graph the information and then give futer incite on there wellbeing 

## Technologies Used 
- i used micro bit as my physical device and used a range of programs form block code for the micro bit, python for the graphs, firebase for thet data base and html to do the write up

# Create
## Dates

- **Week 1:**
    - i worked on the investigation part of the project 
    - i carried out a surrvey 
    - i tryed to find out what i need for the project

- **Week 2:**
    - i worked on plan and design
    - i gathered the pecies of tecnolgy i need like the micro bit
    - i started to make my flow chart and plan on how i am going to program it

- **Week 3:**
    - i made the code for my formula to calculate height and to get my inputs from the micro bit

- **Week 4:**
    - i made the program to write to the data base useing the micro bits

- **Week 5:**
    - i  made the micro bit write out what i need to write to the data base like stride, height, steps, distance and time

- **Week 6:**
    - i did nothing because of the mocks 
- **Week 7:**
    - i made it so that the python can read from the fire base and to display some data 

- **Week 8:**
    - i made it so that i can graph the data i need like time,steps and distance

- **Week 9:**
    - i made the time shows in minutes and made the formaula to calculate the avevrge steps,time and distance

- **Week 10:**
    - i made the graphs to look cleaner and more readable and put in the time to do unit testing on my programs

- **Week 11:**
    - i made the user got proper feed back on their wellbeing and built the age range i needed to give the feed back
    
- **Week 12:**
    - i recorded my video whitch was edited to fit the 5 minute frame 
    - i put all my write up into the html and layed it out

## Problem encountered 


## Important piece of code

# Evaluation 
- i would say that te project i did could have been a lot better i dound have put all the graphs into
