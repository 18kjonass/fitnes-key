## resources
- some of the resources i found online indacates that people are not getting a lot of running and being active outside more. this is because of the pandemic witch forced people inside and not be as well fit to run [covid effects][https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/well/move/pandemic-exercise-habits-study.html].

## research
- **survey results:**
    - Based on a survey I carried out i found out that a lot of my age group dont really run a lot.
    - I found out that over 70% dont do any active sport.
    - I found out that over 63% had a device that could count steps 
    - I found out when asked why over 86% said that it is not very motavating for them 
## target audience
- My device target audience is people of the older age group like 18 and over but it maybe use they the younger Audience. it is for thos who want to keep a recound on how far and fast they travel.
  
## what-if questions
- **for my what if qustion** 
    - What if the user wants to incress thier distance traveled?
    - What if the user wants to decress thier time traveled?
- these qustion will help me carry out my Basic requirements and Advanced requirements 

## main objectives
- i need to find a way to get peoples steps 
- i need to found out how far they travel 
- i need to find the time they toke to travel 
- i need to graph that data 
- i then need to give user feed back on that data 


# plan and design 
## how I will meet the requirements
### aasic requirements
- cheak if the user is over 37 degress this is to cheak if there are sick 
- at the start the user has to put in there height this will go up in incroments of 10 cm when pressed A and 100 cm if B
- when done press A+B to conform the height which will give us the stride length of the user
- to start the run the user will have to press on the other micro bits logo to set the timer to the data base 
- the user then runs to get steps
- user presses the logo button on the micro bit witch sends data to the data base 
- i ask for age to norrow down the grouping 
- i read user data and give them a prodiction and incite on there physical wellbeing
  
### advanced requirements
- for my first what if qustion i gave "What if the user wants to incress thier distance traveled?"
    - i get the users stride, distance and time and then graph the information and then give futer incite on there phyisical wellbeing 
- for my secound what if qustion i gave "What if the user wants to decress thier time traveled?"
    - i get the users stride, distance and time and then graph the information and then give futer incite on there phyisical wellbeing 

## technologies used 
- i used micro bit as my physical device and used a range of programs form block code for the micro bit, python for the graphs, firebase for thet data base and html to do the write up

## dates
- **week 1:**
    - during the investigation phase i went into the project's background, objectives, and potential challenges
    - imade a survey  to gather user data and feed back
    - i identify project needs. like assessed resource requirements such as hardware and software 

- **week 2:**
    - i worked on planning and design involved creating a project plan outlining tasks and datas. this likely                 included defining project objectives and setting priorities
    - i gathered necessary technology components like the micro bit
    - i started to create flow charts and programming plans implies breaking down the project into smaller manageable         tasks

- **week 3:**
    - i developed the code for the formula to calculate height and obtaining inputs from the micro bit this process           involved writing algorithms, implementing logic, and testing the code for accuracy and functionality

- **week 4:**
    - i implemented the program to write data to the database using micro bits input and seril writing to the data          base.
- **week 5:**
    - i configured the micro bit to output necessary data to the database this involved setting up data collection          processes and defining data structures for storage. This step included specifying data attributes             
- **week 6:**
    - i did nothing because of the mocks 
- **week 7:**
    - i enabled python to read from firebase and display relevant data. this step included setting querying
      the database and processing retrieved data for displaying.

- **week 8:**
    - i implementing data graphing for parameters such as time, steps, and distance the projects. This involves             selecting appropriate graphing libraries, designing visually appealing graphs, and integrating them into the          project's user interface.

- **week 9:**
    - i made refinements such as displaying time in minutes and calculating average steps, time, and distance. this         involved fine tuning algorithms, optimizing code performance, and addressing user feedback to                         enhance the overall user experience.

- **week 10:**
    - i improved the visual presentation of graphs and performed unit testing on the programs to ensures the project's quality and reliability. This step involved adjusting layout and formatting and systematically testing software to identify and resolve bugs or errors.

- **week 11:**
    - i implemented a user feedback system for wellbeing assessment and establishing age ranges for feedback. This involved understanding user needs and preferences,  and incorporating mechanisms for user feedback.
    
- **week 12:**
    - i recorded and editing a video presentation to fit within a five-minute timeframe. This involved scripting content, recording video footage, editing footage.
    - i compiled the project write-up into HTML format for presentation. This involved organizing project documentation in a structured and visually appealing manner formatting text and creating navigational aids to facilitate easy access to project information.
  
## unit testing
- i put all my programes that needed number vaules under a function test and tryed to find and see if any vaules caused any prolbems and found all my program was running fine
## problem encountered 
- the aim problem i found my self was the put the vaules into a average formate and then display the vaules to the user
- another problem was trying to find the best way to give feed back to the user given the data.  

## important piece of code


# evaluation 
- i would say that te project i did could have been a lot better i dound have put all the graphs into
